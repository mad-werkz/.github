MADS, also known as the Laboratory for Peace, was an scientific research institute led by Vegapunk, which was active at least over 24 years ago.
There is currently an attempt to revive the group through NEO MADS, which is under the command of former MADS members Vinsmoke Judge and Caesar Clown.

The MADS laboratory took the form of a large paddle steamer sailing the seas and presented itself as a "research lab for peace". It used a white flag with the word "PACIFIST" written on it. The hull featured the name "MADS" and the phrase "Presented by LU FELD".Despite the institute's stated goal of peace, three of its leading members—Queen, Judge, and Caesar—were in fact developing weapons of mass destruction, while its director, Vegapunk, was the only one inventing peace-promoting products.[6] One of MADS's most notable accomplishments includes the discovery of the Lineage Factor, also known as the "blueprints of life itself".[4] This made it possible for them to clone human beings, with the first successful attempt resulting in Stussy.

They were notable enough that the World Government felt threatened by their existence, leading to their persecution and eventual disbandment.
